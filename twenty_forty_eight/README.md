# Twenty-forty-eight
It is April 2014, and the popular game "2048" has not yet been released. Your task is to implement the game in flutter before the official release. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.



## Instructions
To complete this exercise, you will need to do the following:

Create the 4x4 grid and fill it with tiles valued at either 2 or 4.
The game must start with 3-4 tiles randomly placed on the board.
Implement the ability for players to swipe the tiles in any of the four directions and have them move as far as possible in the chosen direction.
Use animation to smoothly move the tiles. You are free to choose the colors for the tiles.
If two tiles with the same value collide, they should merge into one tile with twice the value, and the score must be updated accordingly.
After each move, a new tile must appear randomly in an empty slot on the board.
The game ends when no legal moves are possible (i.e., the grid is full, and no adjacent tiles have the same value).
You must add a restart button so that the player can restart the game and try to achieve a higher score. Also add a quit button that will stop the game.

## Must include: 
* Include functionality to track and display the current and best scores live during gameplay.
* keep score during gameplay and Update the overall best score when the game is over.
* before the game starts, show brief instructions on how to play. 
Remember to follow best practices for coding and game development, and be sure to document your code and any decisions made during the development process.
